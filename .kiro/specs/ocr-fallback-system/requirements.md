# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing OCR functionality by implementing a robust fallback system that uses multiple OCR approaches to ensure reliable text extraction from documents. Currently, the system relies on a mock Cloudinary OCR service. This enhancement will implement a multi-tier OCR system using PDF.js for PDF documents and Tesseract.js as a universal fallback, providing better reliability and reducing dependency on external services.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the OCR system to have multiple extraction methods, so that document processing continues even if one OCR service fails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document is uploaded THEN the system SHALL attempt OCR extraction using the primary method first
2. IF the primary OCR method fails THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt extraction using the fallback method
3. WHEN all OCR methods fail THEN the system SHALL log the failure and mark the document with failed OCR status
4. WHEN OCR extraction succeeds with any method THEN the system SHALL update the document with the extracted text and completed status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a case manager, I want PDF documents to be processed efficiently with specialized PDF text extraction, so that I get accurate text content from legal documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PDF document is processed THEN the system SHALL use PDF.js for text extraction as the primary method
2. IF PDF.js extraction yields readable text THEN the system SHALL use that result without attempting other methods
3. IF PDF.js extraction fails or yields empty/minimal text THEN the system SHALL fall back to Tesseract.js OCR
4. WHEN PDF text extraction is successful THEN the system SHALL preserve formatting and structure where possible

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a case manager, I want image documents and scanned PDFs to be processed with OCR technology, so that text content is extracted from visual documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image document (PNG, JPG, etc.) is processed THEN the system SHALL use Tesseract.js for OCR extraction
2. WHEN a scanned PDF with no extractable text is processed THEN the system SHALL convert PDF pages to images and use Tesseract.js
3. IF Tesseract.js extraction fails THEN the system SHALL retry with different OCR engine modes
4. WHEN OCR processing takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL provide progress updates and timeout handling

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the OCR system to be configurable and maintainable, so that I can adjust OCR settings and add new extraction methods easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring OCR methods THEN the system SHALL allow enabling/disabling individual extraction approaches
2. IF new OCR services need to be added THEN the system SHALL support pluggable OCR providers through a common interface
3. WHEN OCR processing occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed information about which method was used and performance metrics
4. IF OCR configuration changes THEN the system SHALL apply new settings without requiring application restart

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system user, I want OCR processing to handle errors gracefully, so that document upload and case management workflows continue smoothly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OCR extraction encounters an error THEN the system SHALL capture detailed error information for debugging
2. IF all OCR methods fail THEN the system SHALL still allow the document to be saved with manual text input capability
3. WHEN OCR processing times out THEN the system SHALL cancel the operation and mark it for retry
4. IF memory or resource limits are exceeded during OCR THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and clean up resources
